### To Do: 
- Make a thorough list of what preferences/constraints teachers are allowed. 
- Make a thorough list of what preferences/constraints students are allowed.
- Make a thorough list of what preferences/constraints parents are allowed.
- Make a thorough list of what preferences/constraints schools are allowed.
- Make a list of functionality we must accomplish for this project
    - Limited access for students
    - Limited access for parents
    - Limited access for teachers
    - Full access to administration

### Freewrite version of the Problem:

We need a scheduling system for one-to-one classes - Necessity in schedule regularity and consistancy.

The main issues with scheduling are that students and teachers both have scheduling CONSTRAINTS. Sometimes these constraints are simply weighted preference.  

Another issue is teacher call outs. How an we prompt the admins suggestions of teachers to take over? - and given that we need to change the schedule due to call outs - how can we do this with minimal change to the overall schedule?
